#0x0F. C - Function pointers
This project is undertaken during my **Full Stack Software Engineering Course @Alx_Africa Software Programme.

Learning Objectives:
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone:

* What function pointers are and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
