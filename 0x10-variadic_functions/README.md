This project is undertaken during my **Full Stack Software Engineering Course @Alx_Africa Software Engineering Programme.

Learning Objective:
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone:
* What are variadic functions
* How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
* Why and how to use the const type qualifier.
