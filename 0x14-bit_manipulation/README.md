#0x14. C - Bit manipulation C
This project is undertaken during my **Full Stack Software Engineering Course** @Alx_Africa Software Engineering Programme.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone:
* How to look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.
